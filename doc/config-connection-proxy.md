## Connection to "public" nodes
This solution is dedicated for non-technical users who may not be able to properly configure the JSON-RPC node or for those who do not want to waste their time on what others have done before and have made available :-) 

From the user's point of view, the solution is based on several JSON-RPC nodes made available to the users of the _DashMasternodeTool_ and _dashmnb_ apps, by other users of the Dash community. At the time of writing, one of the nodes (actually three, accessed by one IP address) was shared by @chaeplin, a very well-known member of the Dash community, and the other two by me (@Bertrand256).

### Technical information
These nodes are based on the following components:
 * _Dash daemon_ processing JSON-RPC requests
 * _Nginx_ web server, as a frontend for serving SSL requests sent by the applications
 * A Lua script, as a broker between _nginx_ and _dashd_ 

Configuration is based on ethereum-nginx-proxy, adapted to Dash requirements by @chaeplin: 
 https://github.com/chaeplin/dash-ticker/tree/master/web/nginx

### Configuration
When version >= 0.9.5 of DMT application will be run the first time, _"public"_ connections will automatically be added to the configuration. In the _Configuration_ dialog you should see the following three connections:
 * https://alice.dash-dmt.eu:8080
 * https://luna.dash-dmt.eu:8080
 * https://test.stats.dash.org:8080

If you see connections and all three are checked (enabled) you don't need to do anything. If you see connections but they are not enabled, you just need to enable them. I also suggest deactivating all other connections, if any  - these may be connections from the old configuration.
 
If any of the listed "predefined" nodes are missing or are incomplete, follow these steps:
 * Select all the text from the block below and copy to the clipboard (do not miss the square brackets at the beginning and the end of the text):

    }
]
```
 * Right-click on the `Connections` box.
 * From the popup menu choose the `Paste connection(s) from cliboard` action:  
 ![1](img/dmt-config-dlg-public-recover.png)  
 * Click `Yes` to the question whether you want to import connections.
 
As a result, all three connections should be added to the configuration.

### Security
To perform its job, the application must send some data to the JSON-RPC node that may be percieved as sensitive. These are: the client's IP address and the JSON-RPC command themselves with their arguments. 

For example, action initiated by the `Get status` button sends the following data to the node: 
```python
{"version": "1.1", "id": 2, "params": ["full", "19e7eba493a026f205078469566e4df6a5a4b1428965574b55bec2412ddc9c48-0"], "method": "masternodelist"}
```

To maximize user anonymity, all three published nodes don't have enabled logging of any information related to JSON-RPC commands. The logging configuration is exactly the same as in the example scripts provided by @chaeplin: https://github.com/chaeplin/dash-ticker/tree/master/web/nginx.

If despite this, you would prefer not to risk sharing this information, I suggest you disabling the configuration of the "public" nodes and choosing a different connection type: [connection to a local Dash daemon](config-connection-direct.md) or [connection to a remote Dash daemon through an SSH tunnel](config-connection-ssh.md).
