## Wiping hardware wallet
This is a very simple, 2-step procedure, that we perform if for some reason we want to clear the memory of a hardware wallet.

**Steps of the procedure**

2. On the second page, choose the option *Wipe hardware wallet*.

3. In the DMT's message dialog confirm that you really want to wipe the device.

4. Confirm the second time, using hardware wallet's physical button.
